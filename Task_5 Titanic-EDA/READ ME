# 📊 Titanic Dataset — Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### **Internship Task 5 – Data Analyst Role**

---

## **📌 Objective**
Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand:
- Data structure  
- Missing values  
- Feature distributions  
- Relationships influencing passenger survival  
- Insights through visualizations  

---

## **📁 Dataset Used**
Titanic CSV dataset (public):  
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datasciencedojo/datasets/master/titanic.csv

---

## **🛠 Work Completed**
### ✔ Data Loading  
Loaded the Titanic dataset using Pandas.

### ✔ Data Inspection  
- Checked dataset shape  
- Viewed columns and data types  
- Used `.info()`, `.describe()`  

### ✔ Missing Value Analysis  
Identified missing data:
- **Cabin** → ~77% missing  
- **Age** → ~20% missing  
- **Embarked** → ~0.2% missing  

Handled missing values using:
- **Median** for Age  
- **Mode** for Embarked  

### ✔ Univariate Analysis  
- Histograms (Age, Fare)  
- Countplots (Sex, Class, Embarked)  

### ✔ Bivariate Analysis  
- Survival vs Sex  
- Survival vs Class  
- Survival vs Age  
- Survival vs Fare  

### ✔ Multivariate Analysis  
- Correlation heatmap  
- Pairplot for numeric variables  

### ✔ Feature Engineering  
Created new features:
- **Title** extracted from Name  
- **FamilySize = SibSp + Parch + 1**

## **📈 Key Insights**
- Females had significantly higher survival rates than males  
- 1st-class passengers survived more often than 2nd/3rd class  
- Children had better survival probability  
- Higher fare passengers had greater survival rates  
- Cabin column mostly missing → not useful  
- Fare distribution is right-skewed → log transform recommended
